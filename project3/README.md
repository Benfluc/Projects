# Exploratory Data Analysis: Workplace Accidents in Brazil

## Overview
This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on workplace accidents in Brazil, using official datasets to identify patterns, trends, and risk factors associated with occupational incidents. 
The study applies statistical analysis, data visualization, and descriptive techniques to understand the distribution of accidents across industries, regions, and time periods. 
It showcases practical skills in data analysis, Python programming, and the use of libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Achievements / Results
The project successfully identified key insights regarding workplace accidents in Brazil, including the most affected economic sectors, demographic profiles of workers involved, and the frequency of accidents by region. 
Visualizations highlighted significant trends, such as higher accident rates in specific industries and regions, contributing to a better understanding of occupational safety challenges. 
The results emphasize the importance of data-driven approaches for policymaking and prevention strategies in workplace safety.
