## 1. Project Context

This project simulates the operation of a large-scale call center focused on collecting overdue payments, characterized by a high volume of daily interactions and clearly defined operational and commercial performance goals.

The operation is carried out through multiple contact channels — voice, chat, WhatsApp, and email — and involves a structure composed of agents, supervisors, and managers, who rely on accurate, consistent, and timely information to support strategic and operational decision-making.

## 2. Objective of the BI Solution

The objective of this project is to develop a Business Intelligence platform capable of integrating operational data from multiple sources, ensuring data quality and traceability, and providing strategic and operational indicators to support management.

In addition to making data available in an integrated manner, the solution also aims to provide a simple visualization of the top and bottom performing agents using Artificial Intelligence and a scoring system.

The solution aims to:

 - Monitor compliance with operational SLAs;
 - Assess individual and team productivity;
 - Track campaign results and conversion rates;
 - Identify queue bottlenecks and abandonment;
 - Support tactical and strategic decision-making by leadership.

 3. Stakeholders and Information Needs

| Stakeholder           | Necessidade |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Board of Directors | Consolidated view, trends, and results |
| Operational Management | SLA, productivity, efficiency by channel |
| Supervisors | Agent ranking, daily monitoring |
| BI/Data Team | Consistency, traceability, and governance |


## 4. Business Questions

The main questions that the BI solution should answer are:

 - Is the SLA being met by channel and by period?
 - Which agents have the highest productivity? Which have the lowest productivity?
 - Which campaigns generate the highest conversion rates?
 - On which days do the highest conversion rates occur?
 - Where are the main operational bottlenecks?

## 5. Defined Indicators

| Business Question   | Indicator           |  Concept/Definition                                        |
|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| SLA Compliance    | % SLA                | Services completed within SLA / total services                  |
| Productivity         | Services per Hour | Total services / hours worked          |
| Conversion             | Conversion Rate    | Closed deals / contacts made                  |
| Abandonment              | Abandonment Rate     | Abandoned services / total attempts              |
| Efficiency            | AHT (Average Handling Time)                  | Average handling time per service                         |


## 6. Results

At the end of the project, the solution enabled a comprehensive view of the operation, providing reliable data, clear indicators, and dashboards geared toward decision-making, simulating a real corporate BI and Analytics environment.
