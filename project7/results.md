# RESULTS
## 1. General Data

![Dashboard de BI](https://github.com/Benfluc/Projects/blob/main/project7/sources/Dados%20Gerais.png)
On the first screen, the key indicators and overall operational results are presented, including the total amount recovered in credit, the number of contracts closed, and the main performance metrics such as average abandonment rate, conversion rate, and average handling time.

Additionally, this screen consolidates information regarding the total amounts recovered, segmented by campaign and by day of the month, providing an analytical view of performance over the period.

## 2. Operator Data

Next, operator-level rankings are presented, highlighting the best and worst performances based on the operation’s key indicators, such as average handling time, conversion rate, and abandonment rate.

Additionally, it is possible to identify the days of the month on which each operator closed contracts, as well as the campaigns in which they achieved their best performance.

On this same screen, when selecting an operator in any of the rankings—for example, the operator with the lowest average handling time—their detailed indicators are displayed, allowing for an individualized performance analysis.

Although it is already possible to analyze and compare operators’ performance based on this data, the process would be essentially manual and time-consuming. To optimize comparative analysis and make it more efficient, a performance score was developed (for more information on the creation and rules of the score, click here), integrated with artificial intelligence techniques, enabling management to objectively identify operators with the best and worst overall results.

This approach is essential because evaluating a single indicator in isolation, such as the lowest average handling time, can lead to misinterpretations and even recognition of inadequate performance. 
A reduced handling time alone does not guarantee service quality or a higher contract conversion rate, highlighting the need for a multidimensional analysis of operational performance. 
In this context, the developed tool provides a comprehensive and aggregated view of performance indicators, allowing for a more balanced and consistent evaluation of operators’ performance. 
By consolidating multiple metrics into a single score, the solution reduces biases arising from the isolated analysis of indicators and provides management with a more accurate instrument to support decision-making.

## 3. Analytics

![Dashboard de BI](https://github.com/Benfluc/Projects/blob/main/project7/sources/Analytics.png)

On the initial screen, two distinct rankings are presented: the ranking of the best-performing operators and the ranking of the lowest-performing operators, allowing for an immediate view of the performance extremes within the operation.

At the bottom of the screen, cards display the key evaluation metrics, including average handling time, days and hours worked, number of attendances performed, number of contracts closed, amounts recovered, as well as abandonment and conversion rates, providing a consolidated and objective view of individual performance.

![Melhor Operador](https://github.com/Benfluc/Projects/blob/main/project7/sources/Melhor%20Operador.png)

When selecting the top-performing operator in the interface, it can be observed that they achieved a score of 0.75, with 24 effective hours worked, 166 attendances performed, 33 contracts closed, and a total credit recovery exceeding R$165,000. Additionally, they demonstrated a high conversion rate (0.19) and a controlled abandonment rate (0.41).

The other operators featured in the top-performance ranking display similar patterns, characterized by high conversion rates, below-average abandonment rates, significant amounts recovered, and a substantial number of contracts closed.

![Pior Operador](https://github.com/Benfluc/Projects/blob/main/project7/sources/Pior%20Operador.png)

Similarly, when selecting the operator with the lowest score, it is evident that their metrics corroborate the observed poor performance. This operator recorded a conversion rate of only 0.02 and an above-average abandonment rate (0.51). Furthermore, they closed only five contracts throughout the month, totaling a recovered amount of just over R$30,000.

It is noteworthy that, although this operator handled a high number of attendances and maintained a low average handling time, these indicators, when analyzed in isolation, do not reflect strong overall performance, underscoring the importance of an integrated evaluation through the consolidated score.

## 4. Management Insights

The analysis of operational data allowed for the extraction of relevant insights to support managerial decision-making and improve the team’s strategic performance. One key observation is that the top-performing operators demonstrated consistent engagement across all campaigns, with contracts closed distributed among them. In contrast, lower-performing operators concentrated their closures in only a few specific campaigns. This behavior suggests that more engaged and versatile employees, exposed to different campaigns, have higher chances of success—either through a broader repertoire of approaches or greater adaptability to various client profiles.

Another important insight concerns average handling time. It was observed that operators with higher scores have average handling times above the overall operation average of approximately 490 seconds, while lower-performing operators tend to operate below this value. This indicates that longer, well-conducted interactions can reflect greater listening, persuasion, and negotiation skills, which are essential for closing contracts. Therefore, aiming for excessively fast attendances may not be the most effective strategy from a commercial standpoint.

Finally, it was noted that top-performing operators handle up to twice as many attendances compared to lower-performing operators. This underscores the direct relationship between contact volume and commercial results, as a higher number of effective client interactions increases the opportunities for conversion and deal closure. This insight highlights the importance of balancing productivity, service quality, and conversion capability—factors that, when combined, positively impact the overall performance of the operation.
