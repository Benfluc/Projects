# Understanding Sales Behavior through EDA

## Overview
This project aims to explore a real-world sales dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques in order to uncover key patterns, trends, and business insights. By analyzing variables such as profit, sales, discount, customer segments, and shipping performance, it becomes possible to identify which regions, product categories, and strategies contribute most to profitability — and which ones require optimization.

The study provides a data-driven understanding of sales behavior, supporting better decision-making in pricing, logistics, and marketing. Visualizations and statistical analyses reveal correlations between operational efficiency and profitability, highlighting opportunities to increase revenue while reducing delivery time and cost.

## Achievements / Results
- Profit optimization through the identification of the most profitable sectors as well as correlations between volume, margin, and profitability;
- Opportunities for improvement in product shipping logistics and reduction of the financial impact caused by delays;
- Mapping of strategies for promotions and discounts capable of boosting sales and increasing profit.
