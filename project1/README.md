# Forecasting Coffee Export Values Using Artificial Intelligence

## Overview
This project applies time series forecasting techniques to predict monthly Arabica coffee prices using historical CEPEA data. Multiple machine learning models were compared, including MLP, LSTM, GRU, Random Forest, and XGBoost, highlighting the superior performance of neural networks. The goal is to provide actionable insights for the agribusiness sector through Python-based data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation with metrics like R² and MAPE.

## Achievements / Results
- Successfully trained and evaluated multiple time series forecasting models.  
- Neural networks (MLP, LSTM, GRU) outperformed Random Forest and XGBoost.  
- Generated detailed visualizations comparing predicted and actual coffee prices.  
- Modular and reusable code for future predictive analytics projects.
