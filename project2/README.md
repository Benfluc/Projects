# An Study About Logistics Cost Minimization with Northwest Corner Rule

## Overview
This project focuses on logistics cost minimization through the classical transportation 
      problem, applying the Northwest Corner Method to generate an initial feasible solution and 
      the MODI method for optimization. It demonstrates skills in linear programming, algorithm 
      design, and matrix operations using Python with NumPy. The implementation covers supply-demand 
      balancing, cost reduction analysis, and optimization loops, showcasing applied expertise in 
      operations research and computational optimization.
