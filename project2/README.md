# An Study About Logistics Cost Minimization with Northwest Corner Rule

## Overview
This project focuses on logistics cost minimization through the classical transportation 
      problem, applying the Northwest Corner Method to generate an initial feasible solution and 
      the MODI method for optimization. It demonstrates skills in linear programming, algorithm 
      design, and matrix operations using Python with NumPy. The implementation covers supply-demand 
      balancing, cost reduction analysis, and optimization loops, showcasing applied expertise in 
      operations research and computational optimization.

## Achievements / Results
The project successfully applied the Northwest Corner Method to establish an initial feasible transportation plan and later optimized it through the MODI method. 
As a result, it achieved a minimum transportation cost of R$ 1200 with an optimized allocation matrix. 
This process highlights the practical application of operations research techniques, linear programming, and computational optimization using Python and NumPy.
